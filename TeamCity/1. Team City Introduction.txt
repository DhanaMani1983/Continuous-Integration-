TCS                      Visual Studio                   Team City, Artifactory             Windows server

Team City:

Team city provides support for whole .net chain which includes, MSBuild, MSTest, Visual Studio, TC Plugins understand
.net tools very well. TC is java based product.and is used for build configurations and its very straight forward

Setup:


Download the installer, run the installer and select the default path. For components to install select Build Agent and Server

Build Agent is the agent which carrries out build task
Server is the central system which orchestrates build task to multiple agents, server is where managment console resides, install the 
windows service associated with it.

Next we need to select where the data directory needs to be installed, this is the repo where all user data is stored. Its east to migrate 
by copying the data directory to new server and point team city to the data directory path. even if you are upgrading team city we can
point new install to data directory.

Team city bundles jre so no need to install jre on its own on windows. It also installs dotnet-tools.zip which are plugins for .net tools integration
example msbuild integration, mstest, visual studio

Next step is configure build agent properties, you may need to change the serverurl. If the build server and agent are different server then port 9090 needs to be opened
Use appropriate user account.

Next proceed to web based portion where we need to select the database to store the build configuration. TC internal db is hypersonic 

After setting up database, create admin user account, move next to set profile for user. 

Check in service whether TC is running, check netstats to see build server on 8080 and build agent on 9090
